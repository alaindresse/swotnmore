This project is a server-less script to create a web app to manage useful canvases in product management, starting with SWOT and TOWS.

It is also the opportunity to illustrate using React - Redux to build a front-end application, adding other tools I find particularly useful:
  - Jest + Enzyme for unit-testing
  - Storybook for "visual-testing"
