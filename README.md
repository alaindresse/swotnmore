This project is a server-less script to create a web app to manage useful canvases in product management, starting with SWOT and TOWS.

It is also the opportunity to illustrate using React to build a front-end application, adding other elements I find particularly useful to the stack :
  - Flow, for type checking
  - Jest + Enzyme for unit-testing
  - Storybook for "visual-testing"
